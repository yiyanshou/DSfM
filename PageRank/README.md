# PageRank
Rudimentary implementation of the PageRank algorithm.

pagerank.py computes rankings for the nodes of a graph using the PageRank algorithm. Its input is an adjacency matrix stored as a numpy array in a .npy file. It can also randomly generate an adjacency matrix subject to constraints on how many incoming edges each node has.

Several example adjacency matrices from [Page Rank Explained](https://cs.wmich.edu/gupta/teaching/cs3310/lectureNotes_cs331/Pagerank%20Explained%20Correctly%20with%20Examples_www.cs.princeton.edu_~chazelle_courses_BIB_pagerank.pdf)
are included as ex1.npy, ex2.npy, etc. The example from Chapter 3 of "Data Science for Mathematicians" is also included as DSfM_ex.npy.
